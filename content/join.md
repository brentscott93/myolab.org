# Interested in joining the Myolab?

Feel free to talk to Brent anytime or send an email: <a href="mailto:bscott@wm.edu">bscott@<span style="display:none;">ignoreme-</span>wm.edu</a>

Please note, the lab is just starting in Fall 2025 and is currently being built. While students are welcome to inquire about joining, the lab is not at full capacity. Student wanting hands-on research experience will get up and running faster in one of the other existing and well-established labs on campus.
